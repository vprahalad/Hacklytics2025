# Hacklytics2025: CipherAI
## Overview 
CipherAI is a project utilizing AI to encrypt natural language using [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). Provided a prompt, our program will generate a key and encoded message. The key is created by sampling a subset of the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST2)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/stanford-sentiment-treebank-v2-sst2) and utilizing commonly used terms to map to. This is then passed to AI to create a prompt, along with context for which the message should be written in.
